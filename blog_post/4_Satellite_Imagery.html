Sentinel-2, an European satellite mission, offers wide-swath (290 km) coverage 
and high-resolution imagery at 10 m, 20 m, and 60 m spatial resolutions. 
With twin satellites orbiting 180° apart, Sentinel-2 provides several advantages
for mapping seagrass habitats:
<ol>
<li>High revisit time: Sentinel-2 offers frequent revisits, with a 10-day frequency
    at the equator (or 5 days with two satellites under cloud-free conditions), 
    facilitating the capture of clear images.
</li>
<li>
    Multi-spectral bands: With 13 spectral bands including visible, near-infrared, 
    and short-wave infrared, Sentinel-2 provides diverse spectral information 
    necessary for differentiation of seagrass habitats from surrounding substrates.
</li>
<li>
    Open access: Sentinel-2 imagery is easily accessible through the Copernicus Open
    Access Hub, eliminating cost barriers and enabling researchers to obtain data 
    conveniently.
</li>
<li>
    Atmospheric correction: Sentinel-2 Level-2A data comes with built-in atmospheric
    correction, ensuring minimized atmospheric effects and reliable reflectance 
    values essential for further analysis
</li>
</ol>

The signal captured by the satellite's optical sensors encompasses both the 
reflectance from the Earth’s surface and atmospheric effects, such as scattering
 and absorption. To address these atmospheric effects, radiative transfer models 
 are employed. These models simulate how light interacts with the atmosphere and 
 the Earth’s surface, considering various atmospheric parameters like ozone 
 concentration, water vapor content, and aerosol optical thickness. 
 They allow us to estimate the true surface reflectance, referred to as 
 Bottom of the Atmosphere (BOA), by mitigating the atmospheric contributions.
For our seagrass mapping task, we required BOA images. Hence, we opted for 
Sentinel-2 L2A images, which come pre-corrected for atmospheric effects tailored 
to Sentinel-2's sensor properties. This choice was made for its simplicity and 
due to time constraints preventing further preprocessing improvements within our
project timeframe.
We trained different models on the L2A images, using basic image normalization
 as the only preprocessing step to establish a baseline. However, 
 additional preprocessing before training is commonly adopted. 
 One reason is that when capturing images of underwater environments using 
 optical sensors, the water column interferes with the signal received from 
 the seafloor. Similar to the atmosphere, the water column absorbs and scatters 
 light, making it desirable to remove this effect. Additionally, direct light 
 reflection towards the sensor can affect the quality of the images under 
 certain conditions, so this effect should also be removed. The steps for 
 further image processing are described in Part 7 - Image Correction
